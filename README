NAME
    DBIx::Publish - Publish data from DBI as a SQLite database

SYNOPSIS
      my $publish = DBIx::Publish->new(
          file   => 'publish.sqlite',
          source => DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $pass),
      );
      
  $publish->table( 'table1',
          'select * from foo where this < 10',
      );
      
  $publish->finish;

DESCRIPTION
    THIS MODULE IS EXPERIMENTAL

    This is an experimental module that automates the publishing of data
    from arbitrary DBI handles to a SQLite file suitable for publishing
    online for others to download.

    It takes a set of queries, analyses the data returned by the query, then
    creates a table in the output SQLite database.

    In the process, it also ensures all the optimal pragmas are set, an
    index is places on every column in every table, and the database is
    fully vacuumed.

    As a result, you should be able to connect to any arbitrary datasource
    using any arbitrary DBI driver and then map an arbitrary series of SQL
    queries like views into the published SQLite database.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
